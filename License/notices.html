<br>
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in

      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and 
for which the<br>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or 
other modifications<br>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of 
authorship. For the purposes<br>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include 
works that remain<br>

the interfaces of,<br>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, 
including<br>
      the original version of the Work and any 
modifications or additions<br>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is

a Contribution."<br>
<br>

conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a 
perpetual,<br>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, 
irrevocable<br>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative

conditions of<br>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a

irrevocable<br>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made,<br>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise 
transfer the Work,<br>
      where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable<br>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their<br>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s)<br>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You<br>
      institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a<br>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that the Work<br>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct<br>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses<br>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate<br>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute 
copies of the<br>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with 
or without<br>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
that You<br>
      meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry 
prominent notices<br>
          stating that You changed the files; and<br>
<br>
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any 
Derivative Works<br>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, 
trademark, and<br>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work,<br>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to 
any part of<br>
          the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part 
of its<br>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You 
distribute must<br>
          include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained<br>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not<br>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in 
at least one<br>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text 
file distributed<br>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or<br>
          documentation, if provided along with the 
Derivative Works; or,<br>
          within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and<br>
          wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents<br>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes 
only and<br>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own 
attribution<br>
          notices within Derivative Works that You 
distribute, alongside<br>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
Work, provided<br>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot 
be construed<br>
          as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and<br>
      may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions<br>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or<br>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided 
Your use,<br>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with<br>
      the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly 
state otherwise,<br>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for 
inclusion in the Work<br>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and 
conditions of<br>
      this License, without any additional terms or 
conditions.<br>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify<br>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may 
have executed<br>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade<br>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of 
the Licensor,<br>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use 
in describing the<br>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the 
NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or<br>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each<br>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS,<br>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or<br>
      implied, including, without limitation, any 
warranties or conditions<br>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A<br>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the<br>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any<br>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no 
legal theory,<br>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise,<br>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate 
and grossly<br>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be<br>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special,<br>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
arising as a<br>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability 
to use the<br>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss 
of goodwill,<br>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or 
any and all<br>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such 
Contributor<br>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
<br>
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing<br>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose 
to offer,<br>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity,<br>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights 
consistent with this<br>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only<br>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, 
not on behalf<br>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 
indemnify,<br>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability<br>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason<br>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

[OSI Approved License]<br>
GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
<br>
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone 
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. 
It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public 
License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
<br>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
<br>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
<br>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License.<br>
<br>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
<br>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
<br>
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a 
whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from 
the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and 
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do 
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of 
a whole which is a work based on the Library, the 
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim 
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
<br>
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based 
on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br>
<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
<br>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking 
with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at 
run time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
<br>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost 
of performing this distribution.<br>
<br>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering 
access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
<br>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
<br>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 
Sections above.<br>
<br>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>

determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License. <br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability. <br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a 
host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment 
of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open 
Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common

repair or correction.<br>
<br>
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to 
in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who 
may modify and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for 
damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential 
damages arising out of the use or inability to use SAX (including 
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered 
inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of 
the SAX to operate with any other programs), even if such 
holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>

3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth 
in Exhibit A must be conspicuously included in any notice in 
an executable version of Subject Software, related 
documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes the user's

hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient fails to comply 
with terms herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days 
of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject Software which is 
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License 
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any 
rights to use any trade name, trademark or service mark 
whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or service mark of SGI may be used

contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret, 
trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any 
other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or 
warranty, express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable 
law it might be deemed to have been distributed.<br>
<br>
8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has 
knowledge of any one or more third party claims that reproduction, 
modification, use, distribution, import or sale of Subject Software 
(including particular functionality or code incorporated in Subject 
Software) infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, 
Recipient must place in a well-identified web page bearing the title 
"LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description of the

Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web page in the 
Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3, above, and in the 
text of any related documentation, license agreement or 
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER

PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.<br>
<br>
11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for 
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of 
rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and

with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California,

intellectual property claims:<br>
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other 
than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to 
use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and 
distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without 
Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and<br>
<br>
          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, 
using or selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, 
practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the 
Original Code (or portions thereof).<br>
<br>
          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) 
and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first 
distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no 
patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the 
Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for 
infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) 
the combination of the Original Code with other software or 
devices.<br>
<br>
     2.2. Contributor Grant.<br>
     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, 
each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive license<br>
<br>
          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other 
than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, 
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on 
an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code 
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and<br>
<br>
          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, 
using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor 
either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version 
(or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer 
for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) 
Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the 
combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its 
Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).<br>
<br>
          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 
2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes 
Commercial Use of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no 
patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has 
deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the 
Contributor Version; 3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party 
modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of 
Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as 
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under 
Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of 
Modifications made by that Contributor.<br>
<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
     3.1. Application of License.<br>
     The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered 
Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or 
a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, 
and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of 
the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any 
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the 
applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering 
the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br>
<br>
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>
     Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms 
of this License either on the same media as an Executable 
version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to 
anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if 
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it 
initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a 
subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made 
available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that 
the Source Code version remains available even if the 
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>
<br>
     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to 
create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must 
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, 
directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the 
Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or 
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership 
of the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>
          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under 
a third party's intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 
or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source 
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and 
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a 
recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such 
knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in 
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in 
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall 
take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or 
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>
<br>
          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>
          If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of 
patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that 
API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL 
file.<br>
<br>
          (c)    Representations.<br>
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed 
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that 
Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or 
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.<br>
<br>
     3.5. Required Notices.<br>
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such 
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then 
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant 
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If 
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name 
as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You 
must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the 
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership 
rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to 
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may 
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the 
Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify 
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for 
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the 
Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the 
terms of this License, including a description of how and where 
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice 
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable 
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the 
Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license 
of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this 
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not 
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code 
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You 
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must 
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or 
any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms 
You offer.<br>
<br>
     3.7. Larger Works.<br>
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code 
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You 
must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled 
for the Covered Code.<br>
<br>
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br>
<br>
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms 
of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code 
they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file 
described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions 
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute 
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed 
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br>
<br>
5. Application of this License.<br>
<br>
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer 
has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered 
Code.<br>
<br>
6. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
     6.1. New Versions.<br>
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may 
publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
<br>
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
     Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it 
under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such 
Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the 
License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the 
right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created 
under this License.<br>
<br>
     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>
     If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which 
is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You 
must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", 
"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly 
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that 
your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make 
it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which 
differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public 
License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original 
Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall 
not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this 
License.)<br>
<br>
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>
<br>
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS 
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE 
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>
<br>
8. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder 
will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms 
herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which 
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this 
License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent 
infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against 
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as 
"Participant")  alleging that:<br>
<br>
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly 
or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of 
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of 
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a 
mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use 
of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw 
Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a 
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed 
upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not 
withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 
and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day 
notice period specified above.<br>
<br>
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as 
of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had 
made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br>
<br>
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor 
Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such 
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the 
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable 
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 
2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.<br>
<br>
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 
or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or 
any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive 
termination.<br>
<br>
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER 
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, 
THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE 
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF 
SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. 
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION 
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial 
computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," 
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire 
Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br>
<br>
11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning 
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to 
be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
